>>> readline:
reads a line from the CLI that the user typed

>>> rl_clear_history:
clears command history

>>> rl_on_new_line:
often used together, the first tells Readline to place the prompt here (after printing some output)
the second redraws the line buffer on terminal (the prompt)

>>> rl_redisplay:
Change what's displayed on the screen to reflect the current contents of 'rl_line_buffer'

>>> rl_replace_line:
Replaces the current contents of the editing buffer with the given string.
Useful if your program wants to programmatically change what the user is typing.
rl_replace_line(const char *text, int clear_undo)
clear_undo = 1 → undo history for the line is cleared.
clear_undo = 0 → undo history is preserved.


>>> add_history:

>>> printf, malloc, free, write

>>> access:

>>> open, read, close, fork, wait, waitpid
